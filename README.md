# Hierarchical_Clustering
Association rule learning is an unsupervised learning technique that checks for the dependency of one data item on another. I use the association rule learning to find essential rules saying that if customers buy this product, they will have a high chance of buying that other product. Each row corresponds to a specific customer. All these transactions correspond to different customers and all these different transactions. I did not create a matrix of features. After all, I donâ€™t have to split the dataset into a training and test set because it directly learns all the rules by training the Apriori model on the whole dataset. 

```bash
$ pip install -r requirement.txt
