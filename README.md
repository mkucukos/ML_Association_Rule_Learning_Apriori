# Apriori
Association rule learning is an unsupervised learning technique that checks for the dependency of one data item on another. I use the association rule learning to find essential rules saying that if customers buy this product, they will have a high chance of buying that other product. Each row corresponds to a specific customer. All these transactions correspond to different customers and all these different transactions. i trained the Apriori model on the whole dataset, and crated the rules from it.  

```bash
$ pip install -r requirement.txt
```
